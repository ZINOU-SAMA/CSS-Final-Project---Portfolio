# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my final project for the Codedex CSS program. It showcases my journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring web developer. While this project demonstrates my skills in HTML and CSS, it is not fully responsive.

## Website Overview

The website includes the following sections:

- **Header:** Contains the site title, navigation menu, and a hero section with a brief introduction.
- **About Me:** Details my background, skills, and basic personal information.
- **Projects:** Highlights some of my key projects with descriptions and links to more details.
- **Contact:** Provides a form for visitors to get in touch with me.
- **Footer:** Displays developer credits.
